(* Html_lexer: a page's text cut into tokens -- tags, text, comments.

   cs-history:
   Where the rules came from. HTML (Tim Berners-Lee, CERN, 1990; "HTML
   Tags", 1991, had eighteen of them) borrowed its angle brackets from
   SGML (ISO 8879, 1986, Charles Goldfarb's Standard Generalized Markup
   Language), by way of the SGML documents CERN already wrote. In
   theory an HTML page was an SGML document, to be read by an SGML
   parser against a DTD (Dtd.mli). In practice no browser ever had one:
   Mosaic and Netscape read tags with code of their own, each
   differently, and pages were written to whatever those lines accepted --
   "tag soup". For fifteen years what "<a href=x>y" or "<!-- -- >"
   meant was whatever the browser of the day did, and each new browser
   had to find out by trying the others. HTML5 ended that: Ian Hickson
   (the WHATWG, from 2004) wrote the tokenizer down as a state machine
   of some eighty states, the mistakes included -- every sequence of
   characters has a meaning, the same in every browser -- found by
   testing what the browsers did. Firefox 4 (2011, Henri Sivonen's
   parser) was the first to ship exactly it. This module is that
   machine, the states a page of the 1990s needs.

   The tokenizer is the first stage that knows it is reading HTML.
   Characters in, tokens out (notes_browser.md section 3):

     <p class=intro>Caf&eacute; <a href="menu.html">menu</a>

     Start_tag "p" [class = "intro"]
     Text      "Café "
     Start_tag "a" [href = "menu.html"]
     Text      "menu"
     End_tag   "a"

   Nothing here knows that a <p> cannot hold another <p>, or that </a>
   closes the <a>: that is the tree's business (Html_tree). A token is
   only what the characters say -- and where its names come from
   (Dtd.origin): Netscape's extensions added no syntax, only names and
   values, so a start tag is marked when its element is Netscape's,
   and a core element's Netscape attributes are kept apart:

     <font size=+1>   Start_tag "font" [size = "+1"] {Netscape}
     <hr noshade>     Start_tag "hr" [] {Netscape: noshade = ""}

   It is a **state machine**, the WHATWG's (HTML, 13.2.5 "Tokenization"),
   reading a character at a time, the state saying what the character
   means. Here each state is a function and a transition is a tail call
   to the next one, so the machine reads as the spec's list:

                     letter            space           letter
     data ---'<'---> tag open ------> tag name -------> attribute name
      ^                |   '/'           |  '>': emit      | '='
      |                |   '!'           v                 v
      |                |    -> markup    data           before value
      |                |       (<!-- comment, <!DOCTYPE)   | '"'  '\''  other
      |                |                                   v
      |                '-- another char: the '<' was text   value (quoted,
      '------------------------------------------------ '>'  or up to a space)

   What makes it HTML's and not a textbook's, each checked by the tests:

   - **A '<' that starts no tag is text**: "a < b", "<3", "< p>". Only
     '<' followed by a letter, '/', '!' or '?' does anything.
   - **Names are case-insensitive**, lowercased: <P>, <p>; HREF, href.
   - **Three ways to quote a value**: "double", 'single', or none (up to
     a space or '>': <td align=center>); and no value at all (<hr
     noshade>, the value ""). A name given twice keeps its first value.
   - **Entities are decoded** in text and in attribute values
     (Entities.decode): &amp; in an href is an "&".
   - **Some elements' content is not HTML**: inside <script> and
     <style> nothing is a tag until the matching end tag (RAWTEXT: "if
     (a<b)" is not a tag); <title> and <textarea> the same, but with
     entities decoded (RCDATA). The tokenizer needs to know these names
     -- the one place it knows elements -- because the tree comes too
     late to tell it.
   - **Comments**: <!-- ... -->; <!--> and <!---> are empty ones (the
     spec's), and one never closed runs to the end. <!DOCTYPE ...> is a
     token of its own. <? ... > and any other <! ... > are "bogus
     comments", read up to the '>' and kept as comments.
   - **A tag cut off by the end of the page is dropped**, as the spec
     says: "<a href=" at the very end is nothing.
   - **Line ends are normalized** first: CR LF and a lone CR become LF.

   Not done, the WHATWG's cases we treat another way (its tokenizer has
   80 states, ours a dozen): character references inside RAWTEXT (none
   there, as the spec says, and we agree), the "&copy=2" rule for
   attributes (Entities.mli), <plaintext>, CDATA sections (only in
   SVG and MathML), and the parse errors (the spec names each one; we
   recover the same way, silently).
