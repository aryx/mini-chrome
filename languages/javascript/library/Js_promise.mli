(* Js_promise: a value that comes later -- promises, the jobs that
   settle them, and async functions over them.

   A script runs to its end before the page moves again (Js_eval): it
   cannot wait for an answer from the network. It says instead what to
   do when the answer is there. With a callback that is a function
   given to the one who asks; a promise (ES2015) is the answer itself
   as a value, not there yet, that can be kept, given and combined:

   evolution:
   An old idea, late to the web. A value standing for a result not yet
   computed is of the 1970s: "promise" is Daniel Friedman and David
   Wise's word (1976), "future" Henry Baker and Carl Hewitt's (1977);
   Barbara Liskov and Liuba Shrira's "Promises" (1988) gave them the
   shape used here, for calls across a network, and Mark Miller's E
   language the chaining with "when". JavaScript had only callbacks,
   and programs whose every step waits for the network grew sideways
   ("callback hell", the pyramid of nested functions, errors lost at
   each level). Promises reached it through libraries: Twisted's
   Deferred in Python (2002) copied by Dojo (2007) and jQuery (2011);
   then a common rule for "then" that let them work together,
   CommonJS Promises/A (Kris Zyp, 2009) and Promises/A+ (2012); then
   the language (ES2015). async and await came from C# 5 (2012, after
   F#'s asynchronous workflows, 2007) and were in JavaScript in 2017:
   with them code that waits reads as code that does not.

       pending ----resolve(v)----> fulfilled with v
          \------reject(e)-------> rejected with e      (once, for ever)

     const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... resolve(42) ... })
     p.then(v => v + 1).then(console.log)        // 43, later
     p.then(...).catch(e => ...)                 // a throw in a then: the catch's

   **then** gives a new promise: of what its function returns (or
   throws). So thens chain, and a rejection goes down the chain to the
   first that has a function for it. A function that returns a promise
   (anything with a then: a "thenable") makes the chain wait for it.

   **Jobs.** A then's function is never called at once, even on a
   promise already settled: it is put in a queue of jobs ("microtasks")
   that the engine runs when the script, the event's handler or the
   timer's function now running has returned ([drain], called by
   Js_eval after each run and call), in order, to the last -- a job can
   add jobs:

     Promise.resolve().then(() => log(2)); log(1)        // 1 2

   so that code after a then always runs before it, whether the promise
   was settled or not. queueMicrotask(f) adds a job of one's own.

   **async and await** (ES2017) write a chain of thens as plain code.
   An async function gives a promise of what it returns; "await p" in
   it stops the function there until p is settled, gives p's value (or
   throws its rejection, for a try around it), and meanwhile the caller
   goes on:

     async function f() { log(1); const v = await later(); log(3, v) }
     f(); log(2)                                          // 1 2 3

   The function stopped in its middle is a coroutine (Js_coroutine):
   [async] runs a body as one, [await] suspends it and adds, to the
   promise awaited, a job that resumes it.

   A rejection nobody handles is said on the console once the jobs are
   done, "Uncaught (in promise) ...", as browsers do: else a mistake
   in an async function would be silent.

   Less than the real thing: a promise made by a class that extends
   Promise is a plain one; no Promise.withResolvers, no for await, no
   async generators.
