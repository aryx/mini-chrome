(* Js_ast: a JavaScript program as a tree -- the parser's output
   (Js_parse), the interpreter's input (Js_eval).

   Expressions compute a value; statements do something, and may leave
   (return, break, continue, throw). The kinds of node, and their names
   where it is cheap, follow ESTree, the tree the JavaScript tools
   (Esprima, Acorn, Babel) agree on:

   cs-history:
   A tree everyone agrees on is recent. Each engine's is its own and
   private. In 2010 Mozilla let scripts see SpiderMonkey's (Dave
   Herman's "Parser API", Reflect.parse); Ariya Hidayat's Esprima
   (2011), a parser written in JavaScript, gave the same tree in any
   browser, and the tools that followed -- to check a program (ESLint),
   to rewrite tomorrow's JavaScript into today's (Babel), to format it
   (Prettier) -- all took and gave that shape, written down as ESTree
   (2015). It is why JavaScript, alone among popular languages, is
   commonly compiled before it is served.

     1 + 2 * 3            Binary ("+", Number 1, Binary ("*", Number 2, Number 3))
     a.b(c)[0]            Index (Call (Member (Name a, "b"), [Name c]), Number 0)
     x => x * 2           Function { params = [x]; body = [Return (x * 2)]; arrow }
     let n = 0            Let (Let_kind, [ ("n", Some (Number 0)) ])

   A statement carries its line, which the interpreter's errors report
   ("x is not defined on line 3"); an expression does not: its
   statement's line is close enough for a program of a page.

   The printer ([expr_to_string], [stmt_to_string]) writes every
   operation in parentheses, so that a test says in one string how the
   parser grouped the operators: 1 + 2 * 3 is "(1 + (2 * 3))". *)

(* {1 When each came}

   The nodes are grouped by the edition of the language they arrived
   in, each group under its tag, so that the tree can be read as its
   history -- what is the core of 1997, what ES5 added, what a class
   is an extension of. A node that grew later says so beside it. A new
   node goes in its edition's group, or opens one.

     ES1     1997  the first standard, of Netscape's JavaScript 1.1
                   (1996): what the language was born with in 1995,
                   and little more
     ES3     1999  the language of the first web applications: literals
                   for arrays, objects and regular expressions,
                   function expressions, exceptions, switch
     ES5     2009  ten years later (ES4 was abandoned): getters and
                   setters, strict mode, JSON
     ES2015        "ES6", the largest: let, classes, arrows, templates,
                   destructuring, for-of, modules, promises
     ES2016, ...   an edition a year since: ** (2016), async (2017),
                   object spread (2018), ?. and ?? (2020), class
                   fields (2022) *)
