(* Js_regexp: JavaScript's regular expressions, the part pages use -- a
   pattern read into a tree, matched by backtracking.

   Where they came from. Stephen Kleene's "regular sets" (1951, 1956)
   were a mathematician's notation for what a finite automaton
   accepts; Ken Thompson made them a tool, compiling an expression to
   machine code that follows every alternative at once (QED, 1968;
   then ed, and grep, 1973). Those match in time proportional to the
   text. Another line of implementations tries one alternative at a
   time and comes back on failure -- backtracking: Henry Spencer's
   library (1986), then Perl (Larry Wall, 1987), which over the years
   added what no automaton can do: groups referred back to (\1),
   lookaheads, lazy quantifiers. Perl 5's syntax (1994) is what the
   world means by "regex" since, and what JavaScript took in ES3
   (1999). So this matcher backtracks, as Perl's and every browser's
   do: it is the only way to have backreferences, and its price is a
   pattern such as (a+)+b that takes exponential time on "aaaa...".

   (notes_javascript.md.) Hacker News' script counts its stories with
   s.match(/[0-9]+/); a page's scripts split, test and replace with
   them. What is read:

     x  \.  \/  \n  \t  \uXXXX     a character (a byte: the strings are
                                   UTF-8, as Js_value says)
     .                             any but a newline
     [abc] [a-z] [^0-9]            a set, ranges, its complement
     \d \w \s  \D \W \S            digits, word characters, spaces, and not
     ^ $                           the start and the end (of a line, with m)
     \b \B                         a word's edge, and not
     (x) (?:x)                     a group, captured (its number counted
                                   from its "(") or not
     x|y                           either
     x* x+ x? x{n} x{n,} x{n,m}    repeated, greedy; lazy with a ? after
     (?=x) (?!x)                   x is ahead, or is not: nothing consumed
     (?<=x) (?<!x)                 x is behind, or is not
     \1  (?<name>x)  \k<name>      what a group matched, again; a group
                                   named

   and the flags g (Js_builtins': every match), i (case ignored), m
   (^ and $ at each line), s (. matches a newline too), u (. is a whole
   character, not one of its bytes; \u{1F600}) and y (the match must be
   at the position asked).

   A look ahead is the pattern tried from here and its end thrown away:
   jQuery's /^[\s]*[>+~]|:(even|odd)(?=[^-]|$)/ wants ":even" not
   followed by a dash. A look behind is tried from each position before,
   until one ends exactly here. A backreference compares the text again:

     /(["'])(.*?)\1/ on {|say "hi" or 'yo'|}: group 1 is the quote that
     opened, \1 the same one closing: "hi" then 'yo', never "hi' 

   **Matching by backtracking**: each part of the pattern is tried at a
   position with "what comes after" as a continuation; a repetition
   takes as many as it can (greedy) and gives them back one by one when
   what follows fails -- Henry Spencer's way, Perl's, every browser's
   (theirs compile to bytecode). Its cost can be exponential on
   pathological patterns ({|(a*)*b|}); a step budget stops those.

     /a(b+)c/ on "xabbbcx": tried at 0 (fails at x), at 1: a, then b+
     takes bbb, c matches: [1, 6), group 1 [2, 5)

   Not read: classes of Unicode (\p{L}); with u, a set and a quantifier
   still count bytes.
