(* Js_builtins: what a script finds already there -- console, Math,
   String, Number, parseInt, JSON, Object.keys -- and the methods of
   strings and arrays.

   (notes_javascript.md section 8.) They are host functions, OCaml
   functions the engine calls like the script's own. A method call on a
   string or an array ("abc".toUpperCase(), xs.map(f)) finds its method
   in its kind's **prototype** object, [protos] (String.prototype,
   Array.prototype), at the end of the chain Js_eval walks: a script can
   read them, call them on other things, and add its own (TinyChrome's
   C8; class, the exercise left).

   cs-history:
   What is there tells who was copied, and when. Math and Date are
   Java's of 1995, taken in the ten days: Date with java.util.Date's
   mistakes, months counted from 0 and getYear's years since 1900,
   which Java deprecated in 1997 and JavaScript cannot. The strings'
   methods are Perl's and Java's. The arrays' forEach, map and filter
   are of functional languages and came late: Firefox 1.5
   (2005) as "array extras", the standard in ES5 (2009); before them
   every library shipped its own each (Underscore is that library).
   And how thin the standard library stayed was shown in March 2016,
   when one author withdrew his eleven-line left-pad from the npm
   registry and thousands of builds failed: padStart was added to the
   language the next year.

     Math         floor ceil round trunc abs sign sqrt pow min max random PI

     Object.keys, create, getPrototypeOf, assign; Array.isArray, from
     RegExp, Date (Date.now, its getters), Error and its kinds

                  startsWith endsWith split trim repeat padStart concat
                  lastIndexOf charCodeAt substr match replace search (with
                  a regular expression or a string), split by one

   Math.random is **seeded** (Lehmer's generator, the Playground's), so
   that a page of TinyFirefox draws the same numbers each run and a
   golden frame stays golden.

   A function given to map, forEach, sort ... is called back through
   [call], the interpreter's (Js_eval), passed in rather than named, so
   that this module needs nothing of the interpreter. *)
