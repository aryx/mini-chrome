(* Js_operators: what the operators do to two values -- the
   arithmetic and its coercions, the comparisons, the bits.

   (notes_javascript.md section 7.) JavaScript's operators take any
   values and convert them as they need:

     +            adds two numbers, but joins if either side (as a
                  primitive) is a string: 1 + "2" is "12"
     - * / % **   both sides made numbers: "3" * "4" is 12
     < > <= >=    two strings compared as strings, else as numbers; a
                  NaN on either side: false
     === !==      the same kind and the same value (Js_value.strict_equal)
     == !=        [loose_equal]: null and undefined equal each other and
                  nothing else; a number and a string compared as
                  numbers; a boolean made a number; an object its
                  primitive
     & | ^ << >>  both sides cut to 32-bit integers ([to_int32]: the
                  integer part modulo 2^32), the answer one too; a
                  shift's count is its low five bits
     >>>          the same, the left side taken without a sign: the
                  answer is never negative

   The bits are why "x | 0" and "~~x" are the idioms for "x as an
   integer", and why 1 << 31 is negative.

   Not here: && || ?? (they do not always evaluate their right side:
   Js_eval's), typeof, in, instanceof (properties: Js_props).

   11.9.3 (the abstract equality comparison), 9.5 (ToInt32). *)

(* a == b *)
val loose_equal : Js_value.value -> Js_value.value -> bool

(* a number as the 32 bits the bitwise operators work on, and back *)
val to_int32 : Js_value.value -> int32
val of_int32 : int32 -> Js_value.value

(* [arithmetic op a b]: a op b, for the operators above *)
val arithmetic : string -> Js_value.value -> Js_value.value -> Js_value.value
