(* Js_module: modules -- a program in several files, each with names
   of its own, saying which it gives out and which it takes.

     // shapes.js
     export const sides = { square: 4 }
     export function area(r) { return Math.PI * r * r }
     export default class Shape {}

     // main.js
     import Shape, { area, sides as n } from "./shapes.js"
     import * as shapes from "./shapes.js"
     console.log(area(1), n.square, shapes.default === Shape)

   A script's top-level names are the page's: two scripts that both
   say var count share one count. A module's are its own (a scope
   under the globals, Js_eval.module_scope), and nothing leaves it
   but what it exports, by name.

   A module is run once, however many import it: its address is its
   identity. The engine does not know where texts come from -- a
   file, a server -- nor how one address is found from another: the
   host gives both ([create]'s source and resolve; a browser resolves
   "./shapes.js" against the importing module's URL, as a link).

   What happens, for the module asked for ([run]):

     1. its text is parsed, and what it exports is read from its
        statements: each name out, and where its value will be
     2. the modules it names are run first, in the order named (each
        the same way: the whole tree, depth first)
     3. the names it imports are bound in its scope
     4. its body runs

   So a module's imports are there before its first line runs,
   wherever the import is written: import is not a call. That is the
   point of the syntax being fixed (a string, no expression): the
   whole graph of who imports whom is known from the texts alone,
   before anything runs -- which lets a host fetch all the files
   first ([specifiers]), and a bundler put them in one.

   **Live bindings.** An import is not a copy. In

     // counter.js                    // main.js
     export let count = 0             import { count, bump } from "./counter.js"
     export function bump() {         bump()
       count++ }                      console.log(count)       // 1

   main's count is counter's variable itself, read when used. Here
   the importer's name is made the exporter's very binding (the same
   mutable cell in both scopes), and the object of import * as ns
   reads each name where it is when asked.

   **Circles.** a imports b and b imports a: the standard allows it,
   and live bindings are what make it work -- b runs first, with a's
   names bound but not yet given their values; it can define
   functions that use them, and call them once a has run. Here b sees
   a's function declarations (hoisted before anything runs) and
   undefined for the rest, where the standard has an error for a name
   read too early; once a has run, b's names are a's.

   The exports, all the forms:

     export const x = 1, y = 2      export function f() {}    export class C {}
     export { a, b as c }           export default expression
     export { a as b } from "m"     export * from "m"         export * as ns from "m"

   And import("./m.js"), an expression, where the rest are
   statements: a promise of the module's names, for a module chosen
   or wanted only while the program runs. Its text may not be there:
   the host is asked ([set_dynamic]), and the promise waits.
   import.meta.url is the module's own address.

   cs-history:
   JavaScript had no modules for twenty years. A page's scripts
   shared one set of global names, and a library was one global
   object ($, _) by courtesy. The first modules were a pattern -- a
   function called at once whose local names nobody else sees, giving
   back an object -- and then two conventions over it. CommonJS (Kevin
   Dangoor's ServerJS, 2009, Node's from its start): require("m")
   returns the module's exports, a call like any other, run when
   reached, reading a file and waiting for it -- fine on a server's
   disk, impossible in a page, where a file is a request that takes
   time. AMD (James Burke's RequireJS, 2009) for pages: define(names,
   function), the function called when the files have come. A program
   written for one did not run on the other.

   cs-history:
   ES2015 put modules in the language, after years of argument, with
   the choice told above: import and export are syntax, static, so a
   page's graph can be fetched before running and a server's read at
   once. Browsers ran them from 2017 (<script type=module>: Safari
   10.1, Chrome 61; Firefox 60 in 2018), import() is ES2020's. Node
   took until 2019 to run both kinds side by side (.mjs).

   evolution:
   Before browsers ran modules, programs were written in them
   anyway and a bundler (Browserify, 2011; webpack, 2012; Rollup,
   2015, which named tree shaking: leaving out what no import names)
   turned the graph into one file of the old kind. They still do: a
   page of four hundred modules is four hundred requests. What a real
   site sends is modules that were bundled into a few modules.

   modern:
   What is not here: top-level await (ES2022: a module's body
   waiting, and its importers with it), import maps (a page's table
   from bare names like "react" to addresses), JSON and CSS modules,
   strict mode (a module is always strict). A real engine also links
   in a pass of its own, before running anything, and reports a name
   that no module exports for the whole graph at once; here it is
   found when the importer is reached.

   mini-node's require (tools/node's Node_host) is the other
   convention, CommonJS, in sixty lines: compare.
