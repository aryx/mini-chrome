(* Js_eval: a JavaScript program run, by walking its tree.

   cs-history:
   The language. Brendan Eich wrote the first JavaScript in ten days
   of May 1995, at Netscape, which wanted a language for the people
   who wrote pages, to go with Java for the people who wrote programs:
   it was to "look like Java", and under that skin Eich put what he
   admired -- Scheme's functions, first-class and closing over their
   variables, and Self's objects, with prototypes and no classes. It
   shipped in Navigator 2 (as LiveScript in the betas; renamed for
   marketing), Microsoft copied it as JScript (Internet Explorer 3,
   1996), and to keep the two alike it was standardized at Ecma:
   ECMA-262, "ECMAScript", 1997. Its editions are the tags of
   Js_ast.mli: ES3 (1999) the language of the first web applications;
   a fourth abandoned after years of dispute (2008); ES5 (2009); ES2015
   ("ES6": let, classes, arrows, promises, modules) and one a year
   since. The ten days show still -- in ==, in var's scope, in typeof
   null -- because nothing a page relies on can be taken back.

   modern:
   How it is run here is the simplest way: the tree is walked, each
   node's rule applied. An engine compiles the tree first -- Eich's
   own to a bytecode that it then interpreted, as SpiderMonkey, its
   descendant, still does to start with. What made JavaScript fast
   enough to write Gmail's successors in was the next step, compiling
   to machine code as the program runs: V8 (Lars Bak, Google, 2008,
   for Chrome), with Self's own techniques -- hidden classes, inline
   caches -- found again twenty years on. None of that
   is here: this is the language's meaning, not its speed.

   (notes_javascript.md sections 5 to 8.) Each kind of node has its
   rule: an expression's value from its children's, a statement's
   effect. What makes a language of it is three things:

   **Scopes.** A scope is a frame of names and the frame around it
   (Js_value.scope). let, const (and var, read as let: no hoisting) add
   a name to the current frame; a name is looked for in the current
   frame, then the one around it, up to the global one, else a
   ReferenceError. A block, a call and each iteration of a for make a
   new frame -- each iteration its own copy of the loop's let, so that
   functions made in the loop each keep their own i (the spec's
   CreatePerIterationEnvironment). Function declarations are defined
   first in their block ("hoisted"), so a function can be called above
   where it is written. How a scope keeps its names and how one is
   found, the simple way and the fast one, is Js_scope's.

   **Closures.** A function value keeps the frame it was *created* in;
   a call makes a frame for the parameters whose parent is that frame,
   not the caller's. So a function can use, and change, the variables
   of a call that has returned:

     function counter() { let n = 0; return () => { n = n + 1; return n } }
     const c = counter(); c(); c()      // 2: the n of counter's call, kept by c

   **Leaving.** A statement finishes normally or wants to leave: return
   (with a value), break, continue -- an [outcome], passed up by the
   blocks, caught by the loops and the calls. A thrown value (throw, or
   an error of the engine) is an OCaml exception (Js_value.Throw),
   because it crosses calls, the host's OCaml ones included (a callback
   throwing inside forEach).

   **Later.** An async function's call runs its body as a coroutine
   (Js_coroutine), up to its first await, and gives a promise of what
   it will return; await suspends the body until the promise awaited
   is settled. What promises have to do when they are settled is a
   queue of jobs (Js_promise), run to its end after each [run] and
   each [call]: when the script has returned, never in its middle.

   **Names that are not variables.** In "with (o) { ... }" a name that
   is a property of o is that property (a frame keeps the object:
   Js_value.scope's subject); and an object can be a Proxy, whose
   handler's traps are called where a property is read, set, tested or
   deleted. Both are how a library runs a template's expressions
   against a page's data and learns what they read.

   **this.** In o.f(), f runs with this bound to o; in f(), to
   undefined; an arrow has no this of its own, it keeps the one of
   where it was written -- why event handlers are written as arrows.

   The coercions of section 7 are here, over Js_value's conversions:
   + adds two numbers but concatenates if either side (as a primitive)
   is a string; - * / % convert both to numbers; < compares strings as
   strings, the rest as numbers; && and || give one of their operands,
   not a boolean. == is read as === (no conversion: the real ==, and
   its table, are an exercise).

   **Errors**, named as browsers name them, on the line of their
   statement: "ReferenceError: x is not defined", "TypeError: f is not
   a function", "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
   (reading 'y')". And two a page must never do: recurse without end
   (RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded) or loop without end
   -- a page's script runs to its end before the page moves again, so
   [while (true) {}] would freeze the browser; after a budget of steps
   the engine stops it with an error, as browsers ask "A script on this
   page is busy: stop it?". *)
