(* A call's frame: the scope a function's body runs in, and what is in
   it before the body's first line.

     function add(a, b) { var sum = a + b; return sum }
     add(1, 2)

     the scope add was written in
       the call's frame    arguments = [1, 2]     what it was given, all of it
                           sum       = undefined  its var's, there from the start ("hoisted")
                           a = 1, b = 2           its parameters

   A frame goes under the scope the function was written in (the
   closure's), not under the caller's. In it, in this order: arguments;
   the function's own name, if it is a function expression's (var f =
   function again(n) { ... again(n - 1) }: again is the function in
   its body, whatever again is outside; a declaration's name is its
   scope's, and is not here); every var of the body, wherever it is written,
   undefined; then the parameters, each bound to what the call gave --
   which is the evaluator's part ([params]): a parameter can be a
   pattern and can have a default, an expression read in the frame.

   **The simple way** ([simple]) does just that, a name declared after
   the other in the frame.

   **The fast way** ([opti]). What a call declares is known from the
   function's text: the same names in the same order at every call.
   So it is found once ([layout], kept in the function's tree by
   Js_quicken: Js_ast.frame), and a call makes its frame in one go: an
   array of bindings beside the layout's array of names, which every
   call of the function shares; the parameters, when they are all
   plain names, are set by their slot's number, with no name compared
   (with a pattern or a default among them, they are the evaluator's
   as in [simple]). The same frame in the end as [simple]'s, whose
   words these are in another order.

   cs-history:
   var's hoisting is of the ten days of 1995 (Js_eval.mli): a name's
   scope was the function, as in C a label's, and a block made none.
   let and const (ES2015) are the block's, and are not here: the
   evaluator declares them as it meets them. arguments is as old: a
   function could be given more than it names before there were rest
   parameters (...xs, ES2015). *)
