(* Script_url: URLSearchParams -- a query's fields as a script reads
   and writes them.

   A URL's query is a form's fields in one string (Urlencoded.mli:
   "q=caf%C3%A9+au+lait&lang=fr"). Scripts took it apart by hand for
   twenty years, with split("&") and a decodeURIComponent that does not
   know a '+' is a space. URLSearchParams (the URL Standard, in
   browsers from 2016) is the same list as an object:

     const p = new URLSearchParams("q=caf%C3%A9+au+lait&lang=fr")
     p.get("q")                 // "café au lait"
     p.set("lang", "en"); p.append("page", 2)
     p.toString()               // "q=caf%C3%A9+au+lait&lang=en&page=2"
     new URLSearchParams({ a: 1, b: "x y" }).toString()   // "a=1&b=x+y"

   It is a list, not a table: a name may come several times (append
   adds one, set replaces them all by one, getAll gives them), in the
   order written. Made from a string (with or without its "?"), from
   an object's properties, from pairs, or from another one; gone
   through by for-of, as pairs. It is also what fetch sends as a form
   when given as a body.

   The other half of the standard, the URL object itself (new URL(href,
   base), its parts), is Script_host's url_object, older here.

   Reference: WHATWG URL Standard, section 6.2 (URLSearchParams) and 5
   (application/x-www-form-urlencoded). *)
