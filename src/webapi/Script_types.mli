(* Script_types: what Browser_script's modules speak of -- the page's
   mutable copy, a node at a time, and the state of a page's scripts.
   Types alone.

     Script_dom      the copy: thawed from the page's tree, changed,
                     frozen back; its HTML; a selector's elements
     Script_host     the host objects a script sees: an element's,
                     document, location, a URL
     Browser_script  the tasks: the page's scripts run, an event
                     dispatched, the timers; what the browser asks

   Browser_script.mli tells the whole. *)
