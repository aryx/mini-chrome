(* Grid_layout: a grid's arithmetic -- which cells each item takes, how
   wide each column and how high each row, where each starts.

   A grid container (display: grid) cuts its box into rows and columns,
   the **tracks**, and puts each child, an **item**, in a rectangle of
   their cells. Css_grid reads what the style sheet says of them;
   Box_grid lays the items out; this module is the numbers between, in
   and out, as Flex_layout is for a flex container and Table_layout
   for a table.

   cs-history:
   The layout pages had always wanted. Designers lay a page out on a
   grid, as print does; the web gave them tables (1995: the grid, but
   tied to the order and meaning of the markup), then floats, then
   frameworks of classes over floats ("the 960 grid", Bootstrap's
   twelve columns). Proposals for a real one are as old as CSS (Bert
   Bos's "frames" and template layouts, 1996 to 2005). The one that
   became this module came from Microsoft: Phil Cupp and his
   colleagues' Grid Layout shipped in
   Internet Explorer 10 (2012), was reworked in the W3C by Tab Atkins,
   Elika Etemad and Rossen Atanassov (named lines and areas, the fr
   unit kept), and then did what no layout had: Firefox, Chrome and
   Safari all shipped it within one month, March 2017, finished and
   alike. With it the two-dimensional layout is said in the style
   sheet -- "three columns, the middle one takes what is left" -- and
   the markup is free of it.

   1. **Placement** ([place]). An item with grid-area: a name takes the
      rectangle that name draws in grid-template-areas; one with
      "row / column" takes that cell; the others take the free cells in
      order, row by row. A row is added when the last is full.

        areas   'siteNotice  siteNotice'      columnStart: row 1, column 0
                'columnStart pageContent'     pageContent: row 1, column 1
                'footer      footer'          footer: row 2, columns 0-1

   2. **The columns' sizes** ([sizes], with the room: the container's
      width). Each track has a least and a most (Css_grid.track):
      - every track starts at its least: a length, or its content's
        narrowest (min-content, auto, and "1fr" which is auto at least);
      - the room left is given to the tracks that have a most above
        their least, a length or their content's widest, equally, each
        up to its most;
      - what is still left goes to the fr tracks, by their shares;
      - and if there is no fr track, the auto ones are stretched over
        the rest (unless justify-content packs them: [stretch] false).

        Wikipedia's page, 1400 wide, column-gap 24:
          columns  12.25rem (196)   minmax(0, 1fr)
          least    196              0
          the room left, 1400 - 24 - 196 = 1180, all to the fr: 196, 1180

        and inside the second, the article and its tools, 1180 wide:
          columns  minmax(0, 59.25rem)   min-content (nothing in it: 0)
          least    0                     0
          the first grows to its most, 948; no fr, no auto: 948, 0

   3. **The rows' sizes**: the same [sizes], each row's content being
      its items' heights once laid out at their columns' widths. With
      no room said (a container whose height is its content's) there is
      nothing to share: a track is its most, an fr one its content.

   4. **Where each starts** ([starts]): one after the other, a gap
      between two; packed at the start, the end or the centre of the
      room, or spread (justify-content for the columns, align-content
      for the rows -- example.com's "place-content: center" puts its
      two rows in the middle of the window's height).

   An item wider than one track ([contents]) gives its size to the last
   it spans, the others' taken off; not if one of them is an fr, which
   takes what it is given.

   Not done: grid-auto-flow: column and dense; an item's span said
   without a name ("span 2"); baseline alignment; subgrid.
