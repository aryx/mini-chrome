(* Script_document: the document object -- where a script enters the
   page.

     document.getElementById("count")       an element, by its id
     document.querySelector("ul li.done")   by a selector
     document.createElement("li")           a new one, in no tree yet
     document.body, .head, .documentElement, .title, .cookie, .location

   and, because a library asks what kind of thing it was given before
   anything else, the document as a node: nodeType 9, its one child the
   <html> element, an ownerDocument of null. jQuery's selector engine
   keeps no document that fails that test.

   What makes nodes that are not elements is here too:

     document.createTextNode("3")
     document.createComment("a mark")        Vue and Alpine leave
                                             comments where a part of
                                             the page will come
     document.createDocumentFragment()       a parent for nodes on
                                             their way: appended, its
                                             children go in its place
     document.createEvent("CustomEvent")     Script_events
     document.implementation.createHTMLDocument("")   a page of its own,
                                             where a library parses
                                             HTML it does not trust

   Its listeners are the page's (DOMContentLoaded, and every event
   that bubbles ends there); window's are the same list.
