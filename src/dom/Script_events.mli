(* Script_events: an event as a script makes one.

   The browser makes events (a click, a key: Browser_script) and so do
   scripts, to talk to each other: a library announces what it did with
   an event of its own name, and the page listens for it.

   cs-history:
   Which way an event travels was the browser wars' last quarrel. The
   first handlers were attributes (onclick="...", Netscape 2, 1995),
   one for an element. For "Dynamic HTML" (1997) both browsers let an
   event be heard by the elements around its target, in opposite
   orders: Netscape 4 from the window down to the target
   ("capturing"), Internet Explorer 4 from the target up to the window
   ("bubbling"). The W3C's answer (DOM Level 2 Events, 2000) was both:
   an event goes down, then up, and addEventListener's third argument
   says which leg a listener is on. Bubbling is what everybody uses,
   and what is here. Internet Explorer kept its own attachEvent until
   version 9 (2011); hiding that difference was the first job of
   jQuery.

     el.addEventListener("saved", e => console.log(e.detail.id))
     el.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("saved", { detail: { id: 7 }, bubbles: true }))

   An event is a plain object:

     type              "saved"
     bubbles           whether, after its target, it goes up to the
                       target's parents and the document
     cancelable, detail, and whatever the second argument has
     target, currentTarget     set as it is dispatched
     preventDefault()          sets defaultPrevented
     stopPropagation()         sets cancelBubble: no further up
     stopImmediatePropagation()   nor to the next listener

   and what a dispatch looks at is those properties: there is no state
   of an event anywhere else.

   Two ways to make one, the constructors (new Event(type, init), new
   CustomEvent, new MouseEvent...: all the same object here) and the
   older document.createEvent("CustomEvent") followed by
   initCustomEvent(type, bubbles, cancelable, detail), which htmx and
   jQuery still fall back on.

   Reference: Peter-Paul Koch, "Event order" (quirksmode.org), the two
   models side by side; DOM Living Standard, section 2 (events): 2.2 Event, 2.4
   CustomEvent, 2.9 dispatch. *)
