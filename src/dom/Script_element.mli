(* Script_element: an element's members since the first DOM -- what
   libraries reach for.

   Script_host has the tree as the 1998 DOM gave it: parentNode,
   appendChild, getAttribute. Twenty years of libraries (jQuery first)
   showed what was missing, and browsers took it in: a selector tried
   on an element, nodes put beside one another without naming the
   parent, a copy of a subtree, the data-* attributes as an object.
   jQuery, htmx, Alpine and Vue use these when they are there, and some
   only these:

   evolution:
   The standard here follows its users, by name. A selector tried from
   a script was Sizzle's, jQuery's engine: querySelectorAll (2008) and
   matches. jQuery's addClass became classList (HTML5), its .closest()
   (2009) closest, its .append() and .before() the methods of the same
   names (2016), its .data() dataset. Each was first a function in a
   library that millions of pages loaded, then a method every element
   has -- the web's way of growing, which HTML's design principles
   call paving the cowpaths; and why jQuery, having won, is needed less each year.

     el.matches("li.done")      whether the selector selects it
     el.closest("form")         itself or its first ancestor that matches
     el.contains(other)         whether other is it, or under it
     el.append(a, "text", b)    at its end (prepend: its start); a
                                string is a text node
     el.before(a) .after(b)     beside it, in its parent
     el.replaceWith(a)  .replaceChild(new, old)  .replaceChildren()
     el.cloneNode(true)         a copy, with its subtree if true; the
                                listeners are not copied
     el.dataset.userId          its data-user-id attribute
     el.hasAttribute, .attributes, .toggleAttribute, .getAttributeNames
     el.isConnected             whether it is in the page
     el.compareDocumentPosition(other)   who is first, who is inside:
                                how jQuery sorts what it found
     el.dispatchEvent(ev)  el.click()    Script_events

   A page here has no boxes a script can ask about (the layout is the
   browser's, after the script): getBoundingClientRect is all zeros,
   offsetWidth 0. A library that measures to decide gets "not shown".

   Worked example (tests/browser/Unit_script_element.ml):

     <ul id=l><li class=a>1</li><li>2</li></ul>
     const l = document.getElementById("l"), first = l.firstElementChild
     first.matches("ul > li.a")                      // true
     first.closest("ul") === l                       // true
     l.append("3", document.createElement("li"))     // 1, 2, "3", <li>
     first.after(l.lastElementChild)                 // 1, <li>, 2, "3"

   prepend), 4.2.8 (ChildNode: before, after, replaceWith, remove),
   4.9 (Element: matches, closest). *)
