(* Browser_script: a page's scripts, and the page they see -- the DOM.

   cs-history:
   What scripts were given, in order. Netscape 2 (1995) let a script
   reach the page's forms, and write into the page as it loaded
   (document.write); Netscape 3 its images (the "rollover", a picture
   changed under the mouse, was the web's first animation). That was
   all a script could touch -- "DOM Level 0", named afterwards. Then
   "Dynamic HTML" (1997): any element, changed after the page was
   shown -- in two incompatible ways, Netscape 4's and Internet
   Explorer 4's, the worst of the browser wars for those who wrote
   pages. The W3C's DOM (Level 1, 1998; Dom.mli) is the common tree
   that ended it, and what is here: getElementById, createElement,
   appendChild. The rest came from what libraries had to invent over
   it (Script_element.mli), and innerHTML, Internet Explorer's
   shortcut (1997), which every browser copied years before any
   standard said so (HTML5).

   (notes_javascript.md section 9, plan_tiny_firefox.md J3.) The engine
   (languages/javascript) knows nothing of pages; this module gives
   it one. A script reaches the page through **host objects**:
   [document], and an object per element it asks for, whose properties
   and methods are OCaml functions over the page's tree:

     document.getElementById("count")     the element whose id= is "count"
     document.querySelector("ul li.done") the first one Css.matches
     el.textContent = "3"                 its children replaced by the text "3"
     el.innerHTML = "<b>3</b>"            by Html_tree's parse of the string
     el.style.color = "red"               "color: red" in its style= (Css, N5)
     el.className = "done"                its class=: another rule may match now
     el.appendChild(document.createElement("li"))

   **The copy.** The browser's tree (Dom) is a value, built once and
   read by everything since TinyMosaic: the looks, the layout, the hit
   test, the forms. A script needs to change it. So the script works on
   a **mutable copy** -- nodes with a parent, their children and
   attributes changeable -- thawed from the page's tree, and [tree]
   freezes it back into a Dom.element when the browser wants to lay the
   page out again ([changed] says whether it must). An element keeps the
   same host object for as long as it lives, so [getElementById("x") ===
   getElementById("x")] and a variable holding an element stays good.
   Real engines mutate one tree and lay it out again incrementally;
   here the pages are small and a whole layout is milliseconds.

     page's Dom  --thaw-->  nodes  <--  scripts (through the host objects)
                              |
       layout  <--  Dom  <--freeze (when changed)

   **The code** is ten modules over Script_types' types, each using
   only those before it:

     Script_dom       the copy: thawed, changed, frozen, its HTML, a
                      selector's elements
     Script_host      an element's host object as the first DOM had it
                      (parentNode, appendChild, getAttribute), location,
                      a URL
     Script_events    an event as a script makes one (new CustomEvent)
     Script_element   an element's members since (matches, closest,
                      append, cloneNode, dataset, dispatchEvent)
     Script_document  document
     Script_window    window and its globals (the classes Node,
                      HTMLElement...; getComputedStyle, localStorage,
                      MutationObserver, matchMedia)
     Script_fetch     a script asking the network: the request out,
                      the answer back, who may read it (CORS); fetch
     XMLHttpRequest   the same request, the first way
     Script_url       URLSearchParams
     Browser_script   this one: the tasks (the page's scripts, an event
                      dispatched, the timers) and what the browser asks

   Two of them are reached from one before: an element's later members
   (Script_host asks Script_element) and an event a script dispatches
   (Script_element asks this module), through two functions kept in the
   page's state and set here.

   **The scripts** of the page, its <script> elements, run in order once
   the page is read -- as the attribute defer asks, rather than as the
   parser meets them, so a script can find every element whatever its
   place. An error goes to the console (its line and message) and the
   next script still runs, as in every browser.

   **Events** (notes_javascript.md section 10). The browser runs one
   thing at a time, a **task**: the page's scripts at load, one event's
   handlers, one timer's function, each run to its end (a script is
   never interrupted: while it runs, the page does not move); then, if
   the tree changed, the browser lays the page out again -- once,
   however many changes. A click is found in the layout (Hit.element_at)
   and dispatched here ([click]); it **bubbles**: the handlers of the
   element it fell on, then of its parent, up to the document, unless
   one calls event.stopPropagation(); event.preventDefault() -- or an
   onclick="..." returning false, Netscape 2's way -- cancels what the
   browser would have done next (follow the link). HyperCard's path,
   a quarter century before (languages/hypertalk):

     HyperCard (1987)                        the DOM (1998)
     button -> card -> background -> stack   element -> parents -> body -> document
     "pass mouseUp" goes on                  bubbling goes on unless stopped
     the card's script answers every button  a handler on <ul> answers every <li>

   Handlers are addEventListener's (in order), el.onclick = f, and the
   onclick="..." attribute, its text compiled once into a function of
   event. setTimeout and setInterval run on the page's clock, which the
   host moves ([advance]): the frame clock in TinyFirefox, so that a
   golden frame sees the same ticks each run. alert only queues its
   message for the browser to show after the task ([take_alerts]): a
   real one stops the script until OK, which a script that is an OCaml
   call cannot do.

   What it keeps of the DOM (plan_tiny_firefox.md): document's
   getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll, createElement,
   createTextNode, body, title; an element's tagName, id, className,
   textContent, innerHTML, getAttribute, setAttribute, removeAttribute,
   style, value, children, firstChild, parentNode, appendChild,
   removeChild, insertBefore, remove, addEventListener,
   removeEventListener; setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout,
   clearInterval, alert. And, for the web's old scripts (TinyChrome's
   C8, Hacker News' hn.js): getElementsByClassName and ByTagName (the
   document's and an element's), nextSibling, nextElementSibling and
   their previous, classList, an a's href resolved, insertAdjacentHTML,
   scrollIntoView and focus (nothing to do), event.stopImmediatePropagation;
   window (the global object, its size, its listeners the document's),
   location, navigator, new URL(href, base) and its searchParams;
   XMLHttpRequest and fetch (their own modules, XMLHttpRequest and
   Script_fetch), whose requests the browser sends ([take_requests])
   and whose answers it gives back ([answer]). Not: the node types but elements
   and text, NodeList's liveness, ranges, the forms' own interface. A
   form's field typed into keeps its text in the browser (Browser_page's
   values), not in the tree; [value] reads the value= attribute. *)
