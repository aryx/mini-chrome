(* Browser_zoom: Chrome's page zoom -- Ctrl and + (or =), Ctrl and -,
 * Ctrl and 0 -- by its steps, each site keeping its own.
 *
 * It is the whole page that grows, not its fonts alone: the browser
 * lays the page out narrower, at the window's width divided by the
 * zoom (a site's @media rules for a small screen may then hold), and
 * draws it scaled. That part is the program's (MiniChrome); here are
 * the levels and what is remembered.
 *
 *   at 100%, Ctrl +  -> 110%   Ctrl + again -> 125%   Ctrl -  -> 110%
 *   at 500%, Ctrl +  -> 500%   (the last level)
 *   Ctrl 0  -> 100%, and the site forgotten
 *
 * A zoom is its site's (its host's), every page and tab of it, as in
 * Chrome -- which keeps it in the profile; here it lasts as long as the
 * program.
 *
 * evolution:
 * Three zooms, in order. The first browsers could only change the
 * text's size (Netscape's and Internet Explorer's "Text Size"): the
 * letters grew, the pictures and the widths set in pixels did not,
 * and pages broke. Zooming the whole page was Opera's, then Internet
 * Explorer 7's (2006) and Firefox 3's (2008): a CSS pixel becomes
 * more than one dot, the page is laid out again narrower -- this
 * module's. The third came with the iPhone (2007), for pages made for
 * a desk: lay the page out as if on a screen 980 wide, show it small,
 * and let two fingers magnify a part without any new layout; the
 * <meta name=viewport> a page uses to decline that is Safari's of
 * that year.
