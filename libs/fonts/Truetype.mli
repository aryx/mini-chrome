(* Truetype: a TrueType font file read -- a glyph's outline, a
   character's glyph, how far the pen moves.

   The file is a directory of *tables*, each named by four letters;
   the ones a renderer needs:

     head, maxp   the em's size (2048 units, usually), how many glyphs
     loca, glyf   each glyph's place, and its outline
     cmap         a character's glyph number
     hhea, hmtx   each glyph's advance

   A glyph (in "glyf") is contours of points, each *on* the curve or
   *off* it:

       on --- on          a line
       on - off - on      a quadratic curve, the off point its control
       on - off - off - on   two curves: between two off points an on
                             point is meant, halfway -- so that a
                             circle is eight points, not sixteen

   The coordinates are steps from the point before, in one byte or
   two or none (the same as before), a flag saying which. A glyph may
   instead be *composite*: other glyphs, each moved and
   scaled -- an "e" and an acute accent.

   "cmap" has several tables, for several worlds: Windows and Unicode
   (platform 3, encoding 1), a font of symbols (3, 0), the Macintosh's
   own 256 characters (1, 0), each in one of several layouts (runs of
   characters with a shift: format 4, the usual).

   Not used: the instructions. Each glyph carries a program, for a
   small stack machine, that moves its points onto the pixel grid at
   a given size (hinting): what made TrueType sharp on the screens of
   1991 and what, with smoothed edges and screens of twice the dots,
   a renderer can leave out.

   An OpenType font with PostScript outlines is the same file with a
   table "CFF " instead of "glyf" ([cff]; Cff.mli).

   cs-history:
   Apple, for System 7 (1991), designed from 1987 by Sampo Kaasila:
   an outline format of Apple's own, so as not to pay Adobe for Type
   1 and its secret hints. Apple licensed it to Microsoft, and
   Windows 3.1 (1992) had it: the "font wars", which Adobe
   answered by publishing Type 1 (Type1.mli) and which ended in 1996
   with OpenType, one file for both. The web's fonts (@font-face,
   WOFF) are these files, compressed.

   OpenType specification (the tables head, maxp, loca, glyf, cmap,
   hhea, hmtx). *)
