(* Cff: a CFF font read -- Adobe's PostScript fonts made compact, and
   the glyph programs they are written in.

   A Type 1 font (Type1.mli) is a PostScript program, in text,
   ciphered. CFF, the Compact Font Format, is the same font as
   tables:

     a header
     INDEX of names          an INDEX is a count, offsets, and the
     INDEX of dictionaries   things themselves: the format's one
     INDEX of strings        structure
     INDEX of subroutines
     ... and, found from the font's dictionary:
     the glyphs' programs (an INDEX), their names (the "charset"),
     the code of each (the "encoding"), a private dictionary with
     subroutines of its own

   A dictionary is numbers and operators in a byte code (a byte 32 to
   246 is itself less 139; other bytes start longer numbers). Names
   are numbers too: the first 391 are a list every reader knows
   (Glyph_names.cff_strings: "A", "eacute", "fi"...), the others are
   the file's strings.

   A glyph's program (a "Type 2 charstring") is a stack machine's:

     100 0 rmoveto   50 hlineto   0 80 30 -20 40 0 rrcurveto   endchar

   numbers pushed, an operator that moves the pen by them; lines and
   cubic curves, all as steps from where the pen is. To be short it
   has a dozen operators that say less (hlineto: across only;
   hvcurveto: a curve that starts across and ends up; several curves
   after one operator) and subroutines, shared by the glyphs (the
   serif of every letter, once). The hints -- where the stems are, to
   fit them to the pixels -- are stepped over.

   A font for many glyphs (East Asian) is "CID-keyed": glyphs named
   by number, several private dictionaries, a table saying which
   glyph uses which.

   cs-history:
   Adobe, in the late 1990s: a Type 1 font in less than half the
   bytes. It is the outline format of OpenType's PostScript flavour (.otf) and
   of PDF's "Type 1C" fonts, which is where most are met today.
