(* Pdf: a PDF file read -- its objects found, its pages listed.

   A PDF file is a pile of numbered *objects* -- dictionaries, arrays,
   numbers, strings, streams of bytes (Pdf_object.mli) -- that name
   each other by number ("12 0 R"), and at the end a table saying at
   which byte each one starts:

     %PDF-1.4                          the first line
     1 0 obj << /Type /Catalog /Pages 2 0 R >> endobj
     2 0 obj << /Type /Pages /Kids [3 0 R] /Count 1 >> endobj
     3 0 obj << /Type /Page /Contents 4 0 R ... >> endobj
     4 0 obj << /Length 44 >> stream ... endstream endobj
     xref                              where each object is
     0 5
     0000000000 65535 f
     0000000009 00000 n
     ...
     trailer << /Size 5 /Root 1 0 R >>
     startxref
     312                               where the table is
     %%EOF

   A reader starts from the end: "startxref", the table, the trailer's
   /Root (the catalog), its /Pages -- a tree whose leaves are the
   pages, and whose nodes hand down what a page does not say itself
   (its paper's size, its fonts). Nothing else is read until asked
   for: the hundredth page of a thousand is one walk down the tree
   and a few objects, which is what the table is for. PostScript, the
   language PDF came from, had to be run from its first line to know
   what its hundredth page was.

   A file is changed by adding to its end: new objects, a new table
   that names the old one (/Prev). So the tables are a chain, the
   newest first, and an object's place is the first one met.

   Since PDF 1.5 (2003) the table may be a stream of binary numbers
   instead of text, and small objects may be packed together in one
   compressed stream ("object streams"): what every TeX and every
   recent program writes. Both are read here.

   A file whose table is wrong or missing -- cut short, edited by
   hand, as tests/pdf's standard.pdf -- is read by looking for every
   "n g obj" in it ([of_string] does it when the table leads nowhere).

   Not read: an encrypted file (said), the outline, links and form
   fields, the names of pages.

   cs-history:
   John Warnock's memo of 1991, "The Camelot Project": documents sent
   between machines of any make and looking the same on each. Adobe had PostScript
   (1984), which printers understood; PDF, with Acrobat in June 1993,
   is PostScript's picture of a page -- paths, text, pictures, under
   a transform -- with the programming taken out and an index put in.
   An ISO standard since 2008 (ISO 32000-1, PDF 1.7).

   modern:
   For fifteen years a browser showed a PDF through Adobe's plug-in.
   Chrome built a viewer in (2010, Foxit's engine, open since 2014 as
   PDFium); Mozilla's PDF.js (Andreas Gal and Chris Jones, 2011,
   in Firefox from 2013) is a viewer written in JavaScript, drawing on
   a <canvas> -- the proof that the web's own platform could do what
   the plug-in did, and the reason a browser written from scratch can
   reasonably have one.
