(* Pdf_color: what a colour's numbers mean -- the spaces of PDF made
   red, green and blue.

     DeviceGray   one number, 0 black to 1 white
     DeviceRGB    three
     DeviceCMYK   four inks, a printer's: cyan, magenta, yellow, black
                  -- made RGB the plain way, (1 - c)(1 - k)
     ICCBased     a profile: taken as the device space of as many
                  numbers (1, 3 or 4)
     Indexed      a palette: one number, the place of a colour in a
                  table of another space
     Separation,  one ink of a press (a spot colour) and how much of
     DeviceN      it: shown as that much black
     Pattern      not a colour: a tiling (grey here) or a gradient
                  (Pdf_shading)

   The page's operators say a space, then numbers in it ("cs", "sc");
   or both at once for the three device spaces ("0.5 g", "1 0 0 rg",
   "0 0 0 1 k").

   wib:
   No colour management: a profile's numbers are shown as the
   screen's, CMYK is converted by arithmetic, not by an ink's
   measured colour. A black that is "0 0 0 1 k" comes out pure black
   where a viewer with profiles shows a dark grey.
