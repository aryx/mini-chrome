(* Pdf_filter: a stream's bytes as they were before the file was made
   smaller, or made of plain characters.

   A stream names its filters, to undo in order:

     /FlateDecode      zlib's Deflate (tiny_libs' Inflate): nearly every
                       stream of a file of today
     /LZWDecode        Welch's LZW, the first compression PDF had
     /ASCII85Decode    four bytes as five printable characters; z is
     /ASCIIHexDecode   four zeros. From when a file had to go through
                       electronic mail of seven bits
     /RunLengthDecode  a count, then bytes to copy or one to repeat
     /DCTDecode        JPEG: a picture's own, left as it is for the
                       picture's reader (Pdf_image)

   Flate and LZW may come with a *predictor*: each row of a picture
   (or of the table of objects) stored as its difference from its
   neighbours, PNG's five ways (a byte before each row says which) or
   TIFF's -- so that the compression sees runs of zeros.

   "87cURD]i,\"Ebo80~>" in ASCII85 is "Hello World!" (~> ends it).

   cs-history:
   LZW was all PDF 1.0 had (1993). Unisys held a patent on it and
   asked for royalties from 1994; PDF 1.2 (1996) added Flate, free,
   and LZW has not been written since. The same quarrel that made PNG
   (libs/images' Png.mli).
