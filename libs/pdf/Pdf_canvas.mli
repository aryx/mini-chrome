(* Pdf_canvas: the paper -- an opaque picture that shapes, pictures
   and gradients are painted on, inside a clip.

   Everything a page draws comes down to four things, each cut by the
   current *clip*:

     [fill]    polygons (a path's curves made lines) in a colour, by
               the nonzero or the even-odd rule, their edges smoothed:
               a pixel is painted by how much of it the shape covers
     [image]   a picture, its unit square put on the paper by a
               transform -- turned, stretched, mirrored
     [shade]   every pixel in a colour that depends on where it is: a
               gradient
     [blend]   and under all three, "over": the colour laid on what is
               there, by its coverage times its transparency

   A stroke is a fill of its outline (tiny_libs' Stroke); a letter, a
   fill of its contours.

   The clip is what the page asked painting to be kept inside: a box
   of pixels when the clipping path is a rectangle along the axes
   (most are: a page's edge, a table's cell), else the box and, for
   each of its pixels, how much the path covers. A clip inside a clip
   multiplies.

   A shape's coverage is found by filling it white on a black scratch
   picture (tiny_libs' Fill.polygons_aa), reading its box, and wiping
   it: the cost of a letter is its box, not the page.

   cs-history:
   Paths filled by one of two rules, under a transform, inside a clip:
   PostScript's imaging model (Warnock and Geschke, 1984; before it,
   Warnock and Wyatt's "A device independent graphics imaging model
   for use with raster devices", SIGGRAPH 1982). Transparency came
   to PDF only in 1.4 (2001): until then a page was paint that hides
   what is under it. "Over" is Porter and Duff's (Compositing Digital
   Images, SIGGRAPH 1984).
