(* Cookie_jar: the browser's cookies, kept while it runs -- Cookie's jar
   (a value) in a box that the requests share.

   A request reads the jar (the Cookie header it sends) and its answer
   writes it (each Set-Cookie), and so does each hop of a redirection:
   "POST /login, 302, Set-Cookie, GET /inbox with the cookie" is one
   fetch, three uses of the jar. The https:// requests run on threads
   (Worker), the others on the frame's: the box has a lock.

     the page's request ----> [header]   Cookie: SID=31d4...
     its answer        ----> [received] Set-Cookie: SID=...; lang=...
     the page's script ----> [script_cookies], [set_from_script]
                              (document.cookie: not the HttpOnly ones)

   The time is the clock's (Unix.gettimeofday): a cookie past its date
   is not sent. [changes] counts what was written, for who saves the
   jar to know when to (Browser_cookies). *)
