(* X509: certificates -- who a key belongs to, said by someone we
   already trust (ITU-T X.509, 1988; for the web, RFC 5280).

   cs-history:
   A certificate was first an entry's key in a directory: X.509 is a
   part of X.500 (1988), the telephone companies' plan for one
   world-wide directory of people and organizations, which would vouch
   for its entries. The directory never came. Netscape took the
   certificate alone for SSL (1994), and with it the question the
   directory was to answer -- who vouches? -- which went to companies,
   the certificate authorities (VeriSign, out of RSA, 1995), whose
   roots browsers ship. For twenty years a certificate cost money and
   a day's paperwork, and most of the web did without. Let's Encrypt
   (2015; the ACME protocol, RFC 8555) made one free and automatic, a
   program proving it controls the name, and encrypted page loads went
   from under half to nearly all.

   A certificate binds a name to a public key, and is signed by its
   *issuer*; the issuer's certificate is signed by its issuer, up to a
   *root* the system trusts because it shipped with it:

       pop.gmail.com  --signed by-->  WE2  --signed by-->  GTS Root R4
       (the server's key)             (an intermediate)    (in /etc/ssl/certs)

   The server sends its certificate and the intermediates; the client
   builds the path up to one of its roots and checks, at each step: the
   issuer's name is the next one's subject, the signature checks with
   the next one's key, the next one is allowed to sign (a CA: basic
   constraints), today is within each one's dates -- and that the first
   one names the host we wanted (subjectAltName, "*.wikipedia.org"
   covering one label). A certificate the server sends that we do not
   need (Gmail sends GTS Root R4 cross-signed by GlobalSign, for old
   clients) is ignored once a trusted root is reached.

       Certificate ::= SEQUENCE {
         tbsCertificate       -- "to be signed": version, serial,
                              -- issuer, validity, subject, key, extensions
         signatureAlgorithm   -- ecdsa-with-SHA384, sha256WithRSAEncryption...
         signatureValue       -- the issuer's signature over tbsCertificate }

   modern:
   Not checked: revocation (CRLs, OCSP), name constraints, key usage,
   policies -- the parts a browser adds, and what this teaching client
   leaves out on purpose (the tutorial says so).

   modern:
   What a browser adds, since an authority can be wrong or broken into
   (DigiNotar, 2011: false certificates for google.com, used against
   readers in Iran): Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962, 2013), public
   logs in which every certificate must appear, so that a site can see
   what was issued in its name; and its own lists of revoked ones.

   Worked examples (checked by the tests, on real chains captured once
   with openssl, at a fixed date): Gmail's (ECDSA P-256, a P-384 root,
   the extra cross-signed root), Google's (RSA), Wikipedia's (a wildcard
   name, a cross-signed "Root YE"), GitHub's (Sectigo's ECC); each
   refused for another host, after its dates, or with a byte changed;
   the roots' own signatures checked.
