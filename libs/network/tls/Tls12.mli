(* Tls12: TLS 1.2's handshake and records, for the servers that have
   not moved to 1.3 -- what Tls13's client falls back to when the
   ServerHello says the older version.

   The same goal as 1.3 by an older road: more messages, in the clear
   until the very end, and keys made by a function of its own.

     ClientHello            -->                     (Tls13's, offering both)
                            <--  ServerHello        version 1.2, a suite
                            <--  Certificate        in the clear
                            <--  ServerKeyExchange  its ECDHE key, signed with
                                                    the certificate's key over
                                                    both randoms and the key
                            <--  ServerHelloDone
     ClientKeyExchange      -->                     our ECDHE key
     ChangeCipherSpec       -->                     "what follows is encrypted"
     Finished               -->                     the first encrypted record
                            <--  ChangeCipherSpec
                            <--  Finished
     application data      <-->

   The keys: the two keys' shared secret (X25519) is the "pre-master
   secret"; the PRF -- HMAC-SHA256 run in a chain, P_hash -- makes of it
   the master secret (48 bytes), and of that the key block, cut into a
   key and an IV for each direction:

     master    = PRF(pre_master, "extended master secret", hash(messages so far))
     key block = PRF(master, "key expansion", server_random + client_random)
     Finished  = PRF(master, "client finished", hash(all messages))   12 bytes

   A record is an AEAD's output as in 1.3, but its type is in the clear
   in its header and its number is authenticated beside it; with
   AES-GCM the nonce's last 8 bytes travel with each record.

   What is here: ECDHE over X25519 or P-256 (P256), the server's signature by RSA
   (PKCS#1 or PSS) or ECDSA, AES-128-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 with
   SHA-256, the extended master secret when the server has it. Not
   here, and such a server is refused: the RSA key exchange (no forward
   secrecy), CBC suites, resumption,
   renegotiation.

   cs-history:
   TLS 1.2 is RFC 5246, of August 2008: the version that let a suite
   choose its hash (SHA-256 for MD5 and SHA-1) and brought the AEAD
   ciphers. It carried the web for a decade, through the attacks that
   shaped 1.3 -- BEAST, CRIME, Lucky Thirteen, POODLE, Logjam, each on
   something 1.2 still allowed (CBC, compression, RSA exchange, export
   suites) -- so that a careful 1.2 came to mean a short list of
   suites, the one offered here, and 1.3 (2018) is that list made the
   whole protocol. The extended master secret is RFC 7627 (2015), the
   answer to the "triple handshake" attack: the master secret tied to
   the handshake's messages, not to the randoms alone.

   modern:
   Browsers removed TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in 2020; 1.2 stays, for the servers
   that were set up once and left: a university's, a device's.
