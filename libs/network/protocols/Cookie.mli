(* Cookie: what a server asks a browser to remember, and to say back.

   HTTP forgets: each request is answered on its own, and the server
   cannot tell that two of them came from the same person. Lou
   Montulli's cookies (Netscape, 1994: for a shopping cart) are the
   memory, kept by the browser: a response says "Set-Cookie: name=
   value", and every later request to that site says "Cookie: name=
   value" back. It is how a site knows who is signed in -- the value is
   a number that names the session, which only the server understands.

   cs-history:
   The name is a programmer's: a "magic cookie" was Unix's word for a
   token a program is handed and gives back without looking inside.
   Montulli wrote them in June 1994, for a customer's shopping cart
   (MCI's) that Netscape did not want to keep on its own servers; they
   shipped in the first Navigator that autumn, on by default and
   unannounced. The press found them in 1996, and with them what they
   had become: a picture on a page comes from another site, which can
   set its own cookie and so recognize one reader across every page
   that carries its pictures -- the "third-party" cookie, on which
   advertising on the web was then built. The IETF's first standards
   (RFC 2109, 1997, David Kristol and Montulli; RFC 2965, 2000) tried
   to forbid that and to redesign the header; browsers implemented
   neither. RFC 6265 (2011) gave up prescribing and wrote down what
   browsers do, which is what is here.

     GET /login HTTP/1.1                 (the form posted)
                                HTTP/1.1 302 Found
                                Location: /inbox
                                Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
                                Set-Cookie: lang=en-US; Path=/; Domain=example.com
     GET /inbox HTTP/1.1
     Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US

   (RFC 6265's own example, section 3.1.) After the name and the value
   come the **attributes**, which say where the cookie goes back, and
   until when:

     Domain=example.com  to that host and those under it
                         (www.example.com); without it, to the one host
                         that set it and no other (a "host-only" cookie)
     Path=/docs          to the paths under it (/docs, /docs/web, not
                         /docsweb); without it, the directory of the
                         page that set it
     Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
     Max-Age=3600        until then, or for so many seconds (Max-Age
                         wins); without either, until the browser is
                         closed, a session's cookie. A date in the past
                         is how a server deletes one.
     Secure              over https:// only
     HttpOnly            not shown to the page's scripts
                         (document.cookie): a stolen script cannot take
                         the session with it

   A browser keeps them in a **jar** ([jar], a value: the list). A new
   cookie replaces the one of the same name, domain and path. For a
   request, those whose domain and path match its URL are sent, the
   longest paths first.

   What a server may not do is set a cookie for someone else: a Domain
   that the host answering is not under is refused, and so is one with
   no dot ("com"), which every site would share. (A browser has the
   Public Suffix List for that, "co.uk" and thousands more: not here.)

   Not done: the Public Suffix List; SameSite (a cookie is sent with
   every request to its site, whoever asks: a picture on another site's
   page too); the __Host- and __Secure- prefixes; partitioning.

   modern:
   Since then browsers took on the third party themselves: SameSite
   (2016; the default in Chrome since 2020) keeps a cookie from going
   with a request another site caused, Safari and Firefox keep a
   separate jar for each site a third party is seen from
   ("partitioning"), and the Public Suffix List says which domains
   (co.uk, github.io) are shared by strangers.
