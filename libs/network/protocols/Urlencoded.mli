(* Urlencoded: a form's fields as one string -- what a browser sends
   when a form is submitted, in the URL (GET) or as the body (POST),
   and what the server's program reads back.

     q = "café au lait", lang = "fr"
       -> q=caf%C3%A9+au+lait&lang=fr

   The fields in order, each name=value, joined by '&'. In a name or a
   value, the letters, the digits and "*-._" stay as they are, a space
   is '+', and every other byte is '%' and its two hexadecimal digits,
   upper case: "é" is its two UTF-8 bytes, %C3%A9, and a '&' or a '='
   in a value is %26 or %3D, so they only ever separate. The format of
   Mosaic's forms (1993) and of every form since, its name the
   Content-Type a POST says: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

   GET or POST is the page's choice (<form method=post>): with GET the
   fields are the URL's query ("/search?q=caf%C3%A9+au+lait&lang=fr"),
   so they can be bookmarked, and end in the server's log; with POST
   they are the request's body, for what should not be (a password)
   or is not a question but an action (an order).

   cs-history:
   Forms are what made the web more than pages to read. Dave Raggett
   proposed them in HTML+ (1993); Mosaic 2.0 (November 1993) drew
   them; and NCSA's server (Rob McCool) ran a program for the request
   and sent back what it printed -- CGI, the Common Gateway Interface,
   its input this module's string. A search box, a guest book, a shop:
   every "web application" until XMLHttpRequest (1999) was a form
   sent, a program run, a new page. The '%' and two hexadecimal digits
   is the URL's own escape (RFC 1738); the '+' for a space is older
   than that rule and the form's alone, which is why a '+' in a path
   is a plus and in a query a space.

   [decode] is the other way, lenient as servers are: a '+' is a space,
   a '%' not followed by two hexadecimal digits is itself, a field with
   no '=' has the value "".

   Reference: WHATWG URL Standard, section 5 ("application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded"); HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866), section 8.2.1, the form's
   submission. *)
