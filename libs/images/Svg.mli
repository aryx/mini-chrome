(* Svg: a picture as shapes -- the small part of SVG that logos and
   icons use, turned into pixels.

   A PNG is pixels; an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics, W3C, 2001) is a
   drawing's description, XML: shapes filled and stroked, in a
   coordinate system of its own that its viewBox maps onto any size.
   The web's logos and icons are SVG now -- Hacker News' Y, its vote
   arrows, Wikipedia's wordmark, GitHub's icons, Google's G -- because
   one file is sharp at every size, and small: a few hundred bytes of
   text that compress well.

     <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="48" height="48">
       <path d="M4 12 L12 4 L20 12 Z" fill="#f60"/>
     </svg>

   A triangle, drawn in a square of 24 units and shown on 48 pixels:
   every number is doubled on its way to the screen.

   A page has them in four ways, and all four come here
   (about:chrome's SVG card shows one of each):

     <img src=logo.svg>          a file, or a data: URL with the text
                                 in it: read by [parse], drawn at its
                                 own [size]   (Browser_picture)
     <svg>...</svg> in the page  no file and no parsing: the HTML
                                 parser already made the elements, and
                                 the browser hands them as [node]s
                                 (Browser_boxes)
     background: url(x.svg)      as the first, behind a box
     mask: url(x.svg)            the drawing's coverage alone, painted
                                 in the box's colour: an icon that
                                 takes the text's colour

   Three stages, each a part of the file.

   Reading ([parse]): the file is XML, read by languages/xml's Xml
   (which tells XML's own story), and its first <svg> kept as a tree
   of [node]s: the elements and their attributes, the text between
   them dropped.

   The shapes, each made a list of polygons (its contours) in the
   picture's pixels:

     rect (x y width height), circle (cx cy r), ellipse (cx cy rx ry),
     line, polyline, polygon (points), and path (d) with its commands,
     absolute and relative (lower case): M L H V (lines), C S (cubic
     Bezier curves, S's first control point the mirror of the last),
     Q T (quadratic ones), A (elliptical arcs: SVG's endpoint form
     converted to a centre and angles, appendix F.6), Z (closed);

   the curves flattened into lines (elm-playground's Curve.flatten, a
   tenth of a pixel off at most), through the transforms of the
   elements around them (transform: translate, scale, rotate, matrix;
   composed as Affine) and the viewBox's (scaled uniformly and
   centred, SVG's default preserveAspectRatio, xMidYMid meet).

   The path is the format's heart, and a language of its own, made to
   be short: a letter, then numbers, the letter left out when it
   repeats, the separators left out where a sign or a point can do
   (M4 12l8-8 8 8z is the triangle above). An icon set's file is
   mostly these strings, written by a drawing program and by nobody's
   hand.

   Painting: fill (default black; none; a colour: #rgb, #rrggbb,
   rgb(), a few names, currentColor the caller's colour) with its rule
   (nonzero, evenodd), stroke (default none) of stroke-width, and the
   opacities (opacity, fill-opacity, stroke-opacity) -- attributes or
   style="fill: ...", inherited down the tree as CSS properties are. A
   shape is filled by elm-playground's Fill.polygons_aa (its stroke
   made contours by Stroke.contours first), into a framebuffer that has
   no alpha: so each shape's coverage is drawn white on black, then
   laid onto the picture in its colour at that coverage times its
   opacity -- Porter and Duff's over.

   The two rules say what is inside a path that crosses itself or has
   several contours. Evenodd: a point is inside if a ray from it
   crosses the contours an odd number of times; a ring is two circles,
   whichever way they turn. Nonzero: each crossing counts +1 or -1 by
   the contour's direction, and inside is where the sum is not 0; the
   ring's inner circle must turn the other way. A letter O, a
   doughnut, GitHub's cat in its circle are holes made this way.

   Worked example (the tests'): a 4 by 4 picture, <rect x=1 y=1
   width=2 height=2 fill=red/>: its 4 middle pixels opaque red, the
   rest transparent.

   Not done: gradients and patterns (fill="url(#...)", drawn grey), text,
   <use> and <symbol>, clipping, masks, filters, markers, dashes, CSS
   <style> sheets inside the SVG, stroke joins other than round,
   animation.

   cs-history:
   Where it came from. Its picture of the world is PostScript's
   (Warnock and Geschke, Adobe, 1984): a path built by moving, drawing
   lines and curves, and closing; then filled, by one of the two
   rules, or stroked with a pen of some width; all under a current
   transform. PostScript said moveto, lineto, curveto, closepath; SVG
   says M, L, C, Z. PDF (1993) is the same model without the
   programming language, and the curves are those Pierre Bezier at
   Renault and Paul de Casteljau at Citroen drew car bodies with
   around 1960.

   cs-history:
   In 1998 the W3C was sent two proposals to put that model in a page
   as XML, within weeks: PGML, the Precision Graphics Markup Language
   (Adobe, IBM, Netscape, Sun), PostScript's model spelt in tags; and
   VML, the Vector Markup Language (Microsoft, Macromedia and others),
   which Internet Explorer 5 shipped. The working group took neither
   and made a third from both: SVG 1.0, a Recommendation in September
   2001; SVG 1.1 in 2003, which is still what files are written in.

   cs-history:
   Then ten years of waiting. A browser showed SVG through Adobe's
   plug-in; vector drawings on the web were Flash's (Macromedia's,
   then Adobe's own). Firefox 1.5 drew SVG itself in 2005, Opera and
   Safari followed, and Internet Explorer, which had VML, only in
   version 9, in 2011. Two things then made it the web's way to draw
   an icon within a few years: telephones whose browsers had no Flash
   (the iPhone, 2007) and whose screens had two and three dots to a
   CSS pixel, where a PNG icon is either blurred or sent in three
   sizes; and HTML5's parser (Html_tree.mli), which let <svg> stand
   in a page with no namespace and no XML.

   others:
   <canvas> (Apple, 2004; then HTML5), the other way a page draws: the
   same model again -- moveTo, lineTo, bezierCurveTo, fill, stroke --
   but as calls of a script that leave only pixels. SVG keeps the
   drawing: its shapes are elements of the document, found by a
   selector, styled by a sheet, given a listener. Retained against
   immediate, the old pair of computer graphics; a chart of ten
   thousand points wants the second, an icon or a diagram the first.

   others:
   An icon font, what sites did between: the icons as the letters of
   a font, since a browser already drew fonts' curves at any size. One
   colour only, and a private letter read aloud by a screen reader;
   SVG replaced it.

   modern:
   A real browser does not make an SVG a picture and then scale it, as
   [render] does once at the size asked: its shapes are painted with
   the page, by the library that paints everything (Chrome's Skia),
   each time and at the zoom of the moment, and so stay sharp; they
   are in the DOM, and move when a script or a style changes them.
   Here an inline <svg> is drawn again only when the page is laid out
   again, and a zoomed page shows its pixels.

   design:
   Why this module is here and not with elm-playground's PNG and JPEG,
   where it was written: as WebP (Webp.mli), the format was born of
   the web, in the web's own syntax, and to grow -- gradients, <use>,
   a <style> inside -- it needs what a browser has (the cascade, the
   colours' parser). What it stands on stays there and is general: a
   polygon filled with smooth edges, a stroke's outline, a curve made
   lines (tiny_libs' graphics/2d).
